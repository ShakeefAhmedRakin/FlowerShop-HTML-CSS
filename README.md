## Description

"FlowerShop" is an unresponsive website project created using only HTML and CSS. This project was a graded assignment for the [Complete Web Development Course](https://web.programming-hero.com/course-details) offered by Programming Hero. 
The project involved recreating a website provided on Figma while also incorporating a bonus section of my own. It's worth noting that the project received full marks, demonstrating the successful implementation of the required features and design.
